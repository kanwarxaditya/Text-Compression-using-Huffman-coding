# Text-Compression-using-Huffman-Coding
Huffman Coding is an approach to text compression originally developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes". In computer science and information theory, it is one of many lossless data compression algorithms. It is a statistical compression method that converts characters into variable length bit strings and produces a prefix code. Most-frequently occurring characters are converted to shortest bit strings; least frequent, the longest.
